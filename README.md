#### Urban Cities
Overall, Urban cities accounted for the largest amount of rides, drivers and fares in Pyber. However, Urban cities have the lowest rate in average fares per rides, this can be attributed to the high quantity of drivers in these cities. Compared to Rural cities, Urban city driver counts at more than 12 times the amount of drivers in Rural cities. In comparison to Suburban cities, Urban cities have twice as many drivers.

## Summary: 
<ul>
  <li>Recommendation 1: My first recommendation is to look into the fare amounts of Urban cities due to the high number of drivers in comparison to other cities. There could be an opportunity to increase the average fare per rides and driver if the number of drivers decreased. </li>
  
  <li>Recommendation 2: My second recommendation is to decrease fares in Rural cities. High amounts of fares per ride and drivers could discourages new riders for Pyber due to high cost. With lower amounts of rides in Rural cities, making it more economic may increase the amount of rides. </li>
  
  <li>Recommendation 3: My Last recommendation is to see how weather or holidays play a role in the overall trend of rides over the course of the year. This could affect the number of rides throughout the year aside from average costs. </li>
  
</ul>
